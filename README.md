# Ekahau-to-Cisco_Static Channel configuration
 Configure static channel assignment as planned from ekahau.<br>
 <h3>Currently under testing</h3><br>
 Execute the script, specifying ekahau file location/name, Site ID(not currently used), WLC username for ssh, WLC ip address for ssh.  You will be prompted twice.  Initially for the admin password, and then you will be displayed a table showing list of access points and channels.  Once checked, confirm the changes and the script will execute the changes.  (currently it will just print the commands to the terminal)..
